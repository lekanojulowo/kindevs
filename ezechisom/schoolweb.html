                    Jurisdiction as it relates to criminal litigation is the power of a court to entertain a criminal matter. There is a difference between criminal jurisdiction of court and criminal liability of an accused person. Criminal liability has to do with culpability of an accused person. When there is no criminal jurisdiction, the question of criminal liability will not arise. There is a difference between substantive and territorial jurisdiction. In Ibori v. FRN, the Court of Appeal distinguished it as follows: substantive jurisdiction refers to matters over which the court can adjudicate and it is usually expressly provided by the constitution or enabling statute. Territorial or geographical jurisdiction refers to the geographical area in which matter brought before the courts for adjudication arose. Substantive jurisdiction has to do with subject matter. Territorial or geographic jurisdiction has to do with area where the matter arose. When a court lacks substantive jurisdiction, it cannot hear the matter, if it does, it will amount to a nullity. Also, in territorial jurisdiction, courts are usually not seised of matters that occur outside their territory. Thus where ingredients of an offence occur outside the territorial jurisdiction of the court asked to adjudicate over the matter, such court will not assume jurisdiction over the offence for apparent lack of jurisdiction. See R v. SHODIPO. However, where the offence is partly committed in one state and partly committed in another, both states have territorial jurisdiction to try the offender. See OSOBA v. QUEEN; PATRICK NJOVENS v. STATE; section 12A Criminal Code; section 4(2)(b) Penal Code.
